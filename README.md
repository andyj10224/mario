# MARIO

MARIO is a Schrodinger software wrapper that allows one to easily get geometries of protein-ligand docking poses given a pdb code and a ligand geometry file (sdf).

## Using the code

Having the Schrodinger Software is a prerequisite. Call this code
`$SCHRODINGER/run driver.py pdbid ligandfile`

IMPORTANT: Make sure that the pdb file is found in the `pdbs` directory as `pdbs/{pdbid}.pdb`, and the ligand file is found in the `ligands` directory as `ligands/{ligandfile}.sdf`

Example call (provided in the directory), `$SCHRODINGER/run driver.py 4mxo S985`

## Other options

`--retrieve_pdb` => Allows the code to retrieve the pdb file online if the file does not exist at `pdbs/{pdbid}.pdb`

`--run_mmgbsa` => Allows you to automatically run MMGBSA on all the posefiles generated by the pipeline

`--run_apnet` => Allows you to run AP-Net-dG deltaG predictions on the posefiles generated by the pipeline
